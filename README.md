# GoAnimate Legacy Redesigned
This is an API for the original GoAnimate, but with some added-in features. This project is a revival for the old GoAnimate servers for people to learn about, and use. If you are gonna use this service, please give us credit! Anyways, enjoy using this project. This project is for everyone to use!
# How to Use
To access this service, install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) then clone/download this project.	Once done, unzip the folder, copy the path, and execute the following commands in your command prompt (where `{PATH}` is the folder path you copied):
```console
cd "{PATH}\GoAnimate-Legacy-Redesigned-master"
npm install
npm start
```
**When done, go to your web browser and navigate to `localhost`.**
# Alternate Startup Method
In GA Legacy Redesigned, there is a file called faststart.bat, and with this file, you can start GA Legacy Redesigned faster, and easier, without opening up command prompt and typing all of this in command prompt.
